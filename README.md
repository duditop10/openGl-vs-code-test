Simple Beginner OpenGL Falling Circle
=====================================

***This is just a simple begginer openGL program so i can learn some stuff.***
---

This program essentialy just renders a 2d circle and makes it fall to the bottom of screen with an acceleration of 9.8 units (A.K.A *Gravity*).

The circel also collides with the borders of the screen and can be controlled with the arrow keys or WASD.

There's also a ***lot*** of friction because it's essentially impossible to stop the ball if it gains too much velocity (not really it just takes a long time)

This helped me learn a bit about rendering and shaders as well as some basic c++ programming and how projection and translation matrices work.

I still have a few problems with VAOs and VBOs but i'll get the hang of it.

# How to run it
 Just run the exe inside the folder called "just run the exe in this folder". Just make sure that you are running it ***inside*** that folder (or another folder with all the files inside that folder). Pretty self-explanatory.
